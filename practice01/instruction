Project Title: Apache Web Server Deployment on Kubernetes with Complete Setup
Objective:
Deploy a simple Apache web server application on a Kubernetes cluster using various Kubernetes resources to build a robust and scalable architecture.

Components:
Pod Configuration:

Create a basic pod running the Apache web server.
Namespace:

Isolate your application environment by creating a dedicated namespace.
Deployments & ReplicaSets:

Use Deployments to ensure desired state management and ReplicaSets to handle scaling and availability.
Services (Service.yml):

Expose the Apache application using a Service.
Ingress (Ingress.yml):

Set up an Ingress controller to manage external access to your services.
ConfigMap & Secrets:

Store Apache configuration files in a ConfigMap.
Store sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) in a Secret.
Persistent Volumes & Persistent Volume Claims:

Mount storage for Apache logs or other persistent data.
Service Account & Role-based Access Control (RBAC):

Create a ServiceAccount and use RoleBinding for access control.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):

Configure autoscaling based on CPU or memory utilization.
CronJobs & Jobs:

Create a Job for one-time tasks.
Create a CronJob for periodic tasks, like log cleanup or backup.
DaemonSets:
Deploy logging agents or monitoring tools to all nodes.
StatefulSets:
Use StatefulSets if you want persistent, stable network identifiers and storage.
Kind Configuration:
Use a kind-configure.yaml to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for testing.
Tasks to Accomplish:
Create a Kubernetes cluster using Kind with two nodes.
Deploy Apache as a Kubernetes Deployment with ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration.
Expose the Apache server using Services and Ingress.
Use PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims for storing data.
Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for the Apache deployment.
Configure RBAC using ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings.
Create a CronJob to clean up temporary files every hour.
Deploy a logging DaemonSet to collect logs from all nodes.
Scale the deployment using ReplicaSets.
Test failover handling by deleting pods and ensuring automatic recovery.
Monitor and optimize the cluster using Kubernetes metrics.
